# Social Network

This site is a social networking site mimicking twitter. Users can create, edit and delete posts.
Users can also follow and unfollow users.

This app was written using Test Driven Development to ensure that the behaviour was as predictable as possible. The end to end tests were written in Cypress so the site could be previewed while running the tests.

The web app is written in Django using the Django template language.
Tailwind CSS was used to style using a utility first approach.
Vanilla JavaScript (ES6) was used to do network requests and UI updates using the Fetch API.

You can find the live site at https://social-network-production.up.railway.app/
